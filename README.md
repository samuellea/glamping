# NC Glamping

Your task is to create the front-end for a booking website for camping holidays.

A development server has been provided and can be started on localhost port 8080 using the `dev` script.

The server uses `data/glamping.json` and [json server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) to host a REST API.

Information on how to query the data can be found [here](https://github.com/typicode/json-server#routes)

Feel free to modify or add to the data in order to show off what you can do on the front-end but there is no requirement to do so.

## Requirements

- Write a react application to deliver the user stories below.
- Feel free to use any packages or frameworks you would like.
- Responsiveness and accessibility must be considered.
- The site must be visually impressive.
- Put a bit of love into it and show us what you can do!

## User stories

- As a user I can view a list of available sites.
- As a user I can see what features an individual site has available.
- As a user I can add some basic search options to the list.
- As a user I can see when a site is available to book.
